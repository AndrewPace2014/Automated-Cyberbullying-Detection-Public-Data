# Automated Cyberbullying Detection
# ReadMe generated by Copilot

This repository contains a script for detecting cyberbullying using a neural network model. The dataset used for this project can be found at [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenx/cyberbullying-detection-dataset-for-online-content/data).

## Files

- `Explore.py`: 
1) This script loads the dataset, preprocesses the data,
2) trains a neural network model,
3) and evaluates its performance. 

It also extracts feature importances using permutation importance and plots the loss curve.

# All Kaggle data found in the repo is from a public dataset. Only CB_Labels.csv is used
